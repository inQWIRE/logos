# logos

This repository stores the logos designed for inQWIRE and related projects. The inQWIRE and SQIR logos were designed by Kesha Hietala using [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/), an online graphic design platform. The inQWIRE logo is meant to be a Q + Bloch sphere (representing quantum) combined with a checkmark (representing software assurance). The SQIR logo is meant to be a Bloch sphere (for quantum) on a shield (for high assurance, also a "squire" is an apprentice knight). Feedback is welcome :)
